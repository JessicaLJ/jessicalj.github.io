I am currently a postdoctoral researcher advised by [Prof. Jin Zhang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=zhangj4&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1&lang=en) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology. I received the B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Xidian University, Shaanxi, China in 2018 and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science advised by [Prof. Zhenjiang Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhenjili/) from City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China in 2023.

My research interests include mobile health, cyber security and smart sensing.
